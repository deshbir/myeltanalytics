					 [CAPES] New Student registrations for a particular month are determined based on the number of unique students who logged in for the first time in that month.

					  [ICPNA] New Student registrations for ICPNA are not currently available in this report. These numbers need to be determined manually based on month ingestion reports.

				<li>
					 [All Other] New Student registrations in "All Other" institutes are determined based on the number of unique student accounts registered (or created by Admins/Instructors) in that month (irrespective of whether they were used or not). Accounts created in TEST institutes ('COMPROTEST','MYELT','TLTELT' ,'TLIBERO' ,'TLUS' ,'TEST' ,'TLEMEA' ,'TLASIA','API Test Bar Aux', 'MyELT AUX 4', 'QA AUX 4 Test','APRIL 5', 'capesmyelt206_qainfotech', 'capesprod', 'July 16', 'July 17', 'QA AUX 1 Test', 'QA AUX 2 Test', 'CAPES AUX DB 3 Test', 'QA AUX 3 Test') were ignored.
